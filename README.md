CIFAR-10 Deep Learning Project
A comparison of three deep learning models — SimpleNN, AlexNet, and TinyVGG — on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.

Features
Train and evaluate multiple models on CIFAR-10.
Compare accuracy, training time, and model size.
Visualize sample images and training loss.
Dataset
CIFAR-10: 60,000 32x32 color images, 10 classes.
Training set: 50,000 images, Test set: 10,000 images.
Models
SimpleNN: Fully connected network, fast but lower accuracy.
AlexNet: Deep CNN, high accuracy, more parameters.
TinyVGG: Small VGG-style CNN, efficient and accurate.
Usage
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/sushmitaAdhikari7/CIFAR10_DeepLearning.git
